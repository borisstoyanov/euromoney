an assignment I was given at a job interview

Requirements:
 - Firefox
 - JDK
 - Eclipse
 - JUnit
 
 
Setup:
1. Either download the source from my GitHub or directly from the archive location I've send
2. Extract (if needed)
3. Open Eclipse and Import both the projects 
4. Create a user lib containing all files from [extracted_archive]/lib
5. Configure buildpath of each the projects to contain your user lib. 
You should be good to go (if any issues please reach me at: bss.stoyanov@gmail.com)  

Approach: Using BDD and Page Objects a home_page.feature document 
which contains all the tests in readable and the same time executable sintax

It contains 3 scenarios:
1. Verify that the URL of the first image is present
2. Management team page is displayed correctly
3. I want to purchase the book of month

If any issues please reach me.
